        <h1>The Cascade</h1>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Some styles are inherited by child elements. For example, all of the text in this div is the same font. Typographic sytles are usually inherited while others usually aren't.</p>
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>In cases where two conflicting styles apply to one element; more specific rules are applied over less specific rules. More selectors will also take precedence over fewer selectors.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>ID selectors</li>
            <li>Class selectors</li>
            <li>Type selectors</li>
            <li>Other selectors (like * - which has no specificity )</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any level of specificity will override inheritance</p>
        <p>In the case of a conflict of specificity after all of these rules, the rule that was defined <strong><em>last</em></strong> in the css file (or the HTML file) witt be applied.</p>
