            <strong>Arrays</strong> are lists of items that are stored to variables. 
            They can be declared using: <em>const name = [item1, item2, item3]</em>
            It is common to declare arrays as constants not variables in javascript.
            You can space out the items with as many spaces or line breaks as wanted.
            Arrays are dynamic and mutable in javascript, so they can be changes and the 
            length can be changed after declaration, even if they are declared as constants.
            One array can contain multiple data types, even other arrays or objects!
            <script>
                const array1 = ["car","bus","plane","train"];
                const array2 = [
                    "car",
                    "bus", "plane",       "train"
                ];
                const array3 = [];
                array3[0] = "car";
                array3[1] = "bus";
                array3[2] = "plane";
                array3[3] = "train";
                console.log(array1)
                console.log(array2)
                console.log(array3)
            </script> 
        </div>

        <div>
            Array elements can be accessed using indicies, <em>myArray[0]</em> would return 
            the first element of <em>myArray</em>. This allows you to loop over them.  
            You can also change specific indicies using <em>myArray[index] = newValue</em>
        </div>

        <div>
            There are many <strong>built in methods</strong> for arrays in javascript. 
            <em>length</em> is a property of arrays and returns the length of that array.
            THe last element of an array can beaccessed by getting it's length and subtracting 
            one for the index. <em>.push(element)</em> is used to add elements to the end of an array.
            likewise, <em>.pop()</em> removes the last element from an array. <em>.shift()</em> 
            removes the first element and <em>.unshift(item)</em> adds the specified item to the beginning of the array
            <em>indexOf(element)</em> will return the first index of that item in an array.
            <em>join(seperator)</em> will join all of the items in an array into a single string,
            seperated by whatever you have specified.
            <script>
                const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,"hello"]
                console.log("the length of myaArray is",myArray.length)
                console.log(myArray[myArray.length - 1])
                myArray.push(1)
                console.log(myArray)
                console.log(myArray.indexOf(1))
                myArray.pop()
                console.log(myArray.join(", "))
            </script>
        </div>

        <div>
            The most common types of loops are for and while loops, 
            these can do the same things as each other but are formatted differently. 
            They both run over and over until a certian condition is met. 
            There are examples in this div's script element.
            <script>
                let forArray =[]
                for (let i = 0; (i<100);i++){
                    forArray.push(i)
                }
                //these do the same thing
                let whileArray = [];
                let i = 0;
                while (i<100){
                    whileArray.push(i)
                    i++
                }
                console.log(forArray);
                console.log(whileArray);
            </script> 
        </div>

        <div>
            Arrays can be used to loop over the items of an array using <em>for variableName of arrayName</em>
            <script>
                for (item of forArray){
                    if (item % 7 == 0){
                        console.log(item)
                    }
                }
            </script>
        </div>

        <div>
            Maps can be used to return an array that has had a particular function applied to every item in that array.
            Filters are similar but are passed a function which returns a boolean, the new array contains only items for 
            which that boolean was true.
            <script>
                const removeLetterOne = (string) => string.slice(1);
                const arrayOfCats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];
                const misspelledCats = arrayOfCats.map(removeLetterOne)
                console.log(misspelledCats)

                // logs an array of items of arrayOfCats whose second letter is "i"
                const secondLetterI = (string) => (string[1] == "i")
                const secondLetterICats = arrayOfCats.filter(secondLetterI);
                console.log(secondLetterICats)
            </script>
        </div>
