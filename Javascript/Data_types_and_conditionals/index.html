        Data Types and Conditionals
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <div>There are 8 basic types of data in JavaScript. 
            These can all be stored in variables without needing to declare the type
            making JavaScript a dynamically-typed language.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Numbers</strong> represent any numeric value, there is no distinction between Floats and Ints.
            Alongside these, there are the "special numberic valuse" NaN, Infinity and -Infintiy.
            Numbers can only be safely used up to 2<sup>53</sup> - 1 
            because they are stored as 64 bit floating point numbers with an 11 bit 
            exponent and a 53 bit mantissa.
        </div>
        <div>
            Numbers larger than this can be stored precicely using <strong>BigInt</strong>. This can be done by appending n 
            to the end of the number. Eg: 12345678900987654321n or using BigInt() eg: BigInt(12345678900987654321).
            Operations involgving BigInts always return BigInts so, if nececary, they can be converted 
            using Number()
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Strings</strong> are strings of characters surrounded by quotes, they can be concatenated using the + operator.
            Single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or backticks (``) can be used. single and double quotes both declare
            normal strings. Backticks declare <em>template literals</em>, strings that can have variables embedded inside of them using ${} eg: 
            `Hello ${name} you were born in {2025 - age}` They also respect line breaks so you don't need to use the \n character.
            Quotes con be included inside of strings by <em>escaping</em> the quote by putting a backslash before it eg:
            'I\'m not going in there!'
            Strings are immutable.
            <script>
                let string1 = "Hello World!";
                let length = string1.length;
                console.log(length);
                
                console.log(`The character code of character 1 of ${string1} is ${(string1.charCodeAt(0)).toString(2)}`);
                console.log(`Character 1 of ${string1} is ${string1.at(0)}`);
                console.log(`Character 1 of ${string1} is ${string1[0]}`);
                console.log(`${string1} sliced 0-5 is ${string1.slice(0,5)}`);
                console.log(`${string1} from -5 to the end is ${string1.slice(-5)}`);
                console.log(`${string1} in uppercase is ${string1.toUpperCase()}`);
                console.log(`${string1} padded up to length 20 with 0s at the start is ${string1.padStart(20,"0")}`);
                console.log(`${string1} repeated three times is ${string1.repeat(3)}`)
                console.log(`${string1} with "Hello" replaced by "Fuck off" is ${string1.replace("Hello","Fuck off")}`)
            </script>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Boolean</strong> data can only take the values <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>. 
            They can be assigned directly or come as a result of comparisons.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>null</strong> is a datatype of its own. It represents an unknown or empty value. 
            It is usually assigned to variables that do not yet contain any data.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>unassigned</strong> is similar to <em>null</em> in that it is the value given to variables with no data. 
            It is different because it is just the default value such as when a variable is declared eg: let variable;
            <em>variable</em> would be <em>unassigned</em>. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Objects</strong> are used to store complex collections of data. All other datatypes are simple.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>typeof</strong> <em>element</em> will return the type of the element.
        </div>
        <div>
            Conditionals use if, else and else if. If and else if require brackets around the condition that they operate under.
            These all require curly braces to enclose the code that will execute if the outcome is true.
            <script>
                let three
                if (3 == (2.1)){
                    three = true
                } else {
                    three = false
                }
                console.log(three)
            </script>
        </div>
        <div>Logical operators operators that return true or false. JavaScript uses "||" for <em>OR</em>,
            "!" for <em>NOT</em> and "&&" for <em>AND</em> (Typed ALT + 038).
        </div>
        <div>
            The <strong>Ternary Operator</strong> can be used instead of an if else statement.
            variable == true ? variable = false : variable = true
        </div>
        <div>
            The <strong>switch</strong> statement can replace if ... else if statements.
            switch (variable) { case 1: variable = 2; case 2: variable = 1;} 
            This checks if <em>variable</em> is 1 and if it is, it changes <em>variable</em> to 2. 
            It then checks if <em>variable</em> is 2 and if it is, it changes it to 1.
            This uses the === operator so 1 != "1"
        </div>

                 Be sure to uncomment the items under each step below the editable section. Be sure to comment out the entire last step. If your code fails to run, or you see a "ReferenceError" in the console, make sure you have completed all of the objectives 
                
                Don't forget you can put "console.log" anywhere to see what your values are at any time.
                
                
                
                    Step 1:
                    Take a look at this code and try to predict what it's going to do before running it...
                    
                    After making your guess, press 'run' at the top and take a look at the output in the console. If you were surprised by anything, go back and look at the code to see what's going on.
                    



                    Step 2:
                    Once you have a good handle on the code snippet, delete the code then follow the following instructions between the lines and try to recreate the snippet on your own.
                    
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------
                    
                    4 variables: first name, last name, current year, and birth year.
                    a 5th variable (greeting) that is constructed from the previous 4, it should contain a greeting with the person's full name and their age.
                    print the greeting with console.log
                    
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------
                    
                    Once you have your version of the code working let's go back over it and edit it to make it easier to read.  After each step, make sure to run the code to make sure the code still works!





                    Step 3:
                    Add 2 more variables: "fullName" and "age"

                    Edit the greeting string to use fullName and age instead of doing the calculations in the string itself. (the greeting should look something like this: "Hello, my name is " + fullName)

                    Do NOT simply type the full name and age into the new variables, but set them using the calculations that were originally being done in the greeting.
                    
                    ===== NOTE ====
                    In order to make the tests pass you will need to use these exact values for the years and names.  The wording needs to be exact.  If the tests fail, check spacing and punctuation:
                    
                    birthYear = 1948
                    thisYear = 1965
                    firstName = Carlos
                    lastName = Stevenson

                    The greeting should say "Hello! My name is Carlos Stevenson and I am 17 years old."
                */
