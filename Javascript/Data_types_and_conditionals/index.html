        <div>There are 8 basic types of data in JavaScript. 
            These can all be stored in variables without needing to declare the type
            making JavaScript a dynamically-typed language.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Numbers</strong> represent any numeric value, there is no distinction between Floats and Ints.
            Alongside these, there are the "special numberic valuse" NaN, Infinity and -Infintiy.
            Numbers can only be safely used up to 2<sup>53</sup> - 1 
            because they are stored as 64 bit floating point numbers with an 11 bit 
            exponent and a 53 bit mantissa.
        </div>
        <div>
            Numbers larger than this can be stored precicely using <strong>BigInt</strong>. This can be done by appending n 
            to the end of the number. Eg: 12345678900987654321n or using BigInt() eg: BigInt(12345678900987654321).
            Operations involgving BigInts always return BigInts so, if nececary, they can be converted 
            using Number()
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Strings</strong> are strings of characters surrounded by quotes, they can be concatenated using the + operator.
            Single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or backticks (``) can be used. single and double quotes both declare
            normal strings. Backticks declare <em>template literals</em>, strings that can have variables embedded inside of them using ${} eg: 
            `Hello ${name} you were born in {2025 - age}` They also respect line breaks so you don't need to use the \n character.
            Quotes con be included inside of strings by <em>escaping</em> the quote by putting a backslash before it eg:
            'I\'m not going in there!'
            Strings are immutable.
            <script>
                let string1 = "Hello World!";
                let length = string1.length;
                console.log(length);
                
                console.log(`The character code of character 1 of ${string1} is ${(string1.charCodeAt(0)).toString(2)}`);
                console.log(`Character 1 of ${string1} is ${string1.at(0)}`);
                console.log(`Character 1 of ${string1} is ${string1[0]}`);
                console.log(`${string1} sliced 0-5 is ${string1.slice(0,5)}`);
                console.log(`${string1} from -5 to the end is ${string1.slice(-5)}`);
                console.log(`${string1} in uppercase is ${string1.toUpperCase()}`);
                console.log(`${string1} padded up to length 20 with 0s at the start is ${string1.padStart(20,"0")}`);
                console.log(`${string1} repeated three times is ${string1.repeat(3)}`)
                console.log(`${string1} with "Hello" replaced by "Fuck off" is ${string1.replace("Hello","Fuck off")}`)
            </script>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Boolean</strong> data can only take the values <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>. 
            They can be assigned directly or come as a result of comparisons.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>null</strong> is a datatype of its own. It represents an unknown or empty value. 
            It is usually assigned to variables that do not yet contain any data.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>unassigned</strong> is similar to <em>null</em> in that it is the value given to variables with no data. 
            It is different because it is just the default value such as when a variable is declared eg: let variable;
            <em>variable</em> would be <em>unassigned</em>. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Objects</strong> are used to store complex collections of data. All other datatypes are simple.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>typeof</strong> <em>element</em> will return the type of the element.
        </div>
        <div>
            Conditionals use if, else and else if. If and else if require brackets around the condition that they operate under.
            These all require curly braces to enclose the code that will execute if the outcome is true.
            <script>
                let three
                if (3 == (2.1)){
                    three = true
                } else {
                    three = false
                }
                console.log(three)
            </script>
        </div>
        <div>Logical operators operators that return true or false. JavaScript uses "||" for <em>OR</em>,
            "!" for <em>NOT</em> and "&&" for <em>AND</em> (Typed ALT + 038).
        </div>
        <div>
            The <strong>Ternary Operator</strong> can be used instead of an if else statement.
            variable == true ? variable = false : variable = true
        </div>
    </div>
